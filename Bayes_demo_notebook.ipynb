    "# Gaussian Processes\n",
    "Gaussian process can be seen as Bayesian Regression with \"possibly infinite\" basis functions. What the difference comes down to is the useage of basis functions. In the case of GPs, a kernel is used, which is defined by N basis functions. Therefore, our design Matrix is N by N. Put naiively, the locations of the gaussian basis functions $\\pmb{\\mu_j}$ are the training points themselves $\\pmb{\\mu}_j=\\pmb{x}_1,\\pmb{x}_2,\\pmb{x}_3 \\ldots \\pmb{x}_N$ .  This saves us from defining the number of basis functions to use,and where to place them. We can use the evidence function above to compute the necessary parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can therefore minimize the error between a test set of data, and our model to determine an appropriate basis function hyper parameter $s$. Various optimization algorithms can be used to do such. In this case, test data is data that has been split from the original dataset and is used solely for this purpose. A small validation set is also taken from the training data to ensure the model found after optimizing $s$ is found.\n",

    "## Recap\n",
    "Gaussian process input vector $\\pmb{x}=\\pmb{x}_1,\\pmb{x}_2 \\ldots \\pmb{x}_N$ and observed outputs $\\pmb{t}=t_1,t_2, \\ldots, t_N$ are split into three sections, training, testing and validation sets. The training sets are used for the maximizing the likelihood of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ while the testing set is used for the optimization of the hyperparamter $s$.   \n",
